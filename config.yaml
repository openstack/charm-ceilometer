      NOTE: updating this setting to a source that is known to provide
      a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software upgrade unless

      instead of an upgrade running automatically across all units, it will
      wait for you to execute the openstack-upgrade action for this charm on
      each unit. If False it will revert to existing behavior of upgrading
      all units on config change.
